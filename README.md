# CHIMEHSDE002
2nd Project

Python Version: 3.6

Run command:
python MarkTwain_Quotes.py
python GoodRead_OAuth.py

Details:

1) 1st program will extract top 10 quotes for mark twain and will store in quotes_file.txt
2) 2nd will ask you to go to particular link printed on console for authentication, if you will be authenticated it will return authentication token, due to time constraint I was not able to do authentication programatically, but can do if given as task.

Test cases: I have not added test cases as I was not able to do authentication but I am suggesting you what kind of test case will help in this project.

1) See true combination of username/ password works or not.
2) See false combination of username/ password works or not.
3) Check number of quotes returned is 10 or not.
4) Check quotes returned are from mark twain or not.
